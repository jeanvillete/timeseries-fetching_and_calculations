Instructions for the Hiring Manager;
I've zipped the entire Eclipse project directory, it contains even the .git directory which shows my log trail.
As soon as you import the project, on the root of the project structure there's a file called analyses.txt where I describe what I understood from the exercise and my proposed solution.

About the code, in order to be run, please, open and execute with JUnit the class TimeSeriesProcessorTest.
On this artifactory there's only one method which I left commented what I think would be important for your comprehension.
I developed it as 'generic' as I could, and to be honest it has been really cool have worked on it.
Furthermore, if it is ok, I'd like to release it on my github profile; https://github.com/jeanvillete/

Note: This program has been developed based on requirements defined on the exercise, and it is supposed to be considered only for that, thus, of course shouldn't be considered for production.
In a real life, probably frameworks such as Spring Batch and/or Spring Integration (Enterprise Integration Patterns) would be a reasonable option instead, which would import the input file to a structure such as a database (e.g; RDBMS), furthermore, most of desired queries could be performed on this stable database, almost avoiding any Java process for it.
